A really basic text-based game where your goal is simply to make and sell moonshine. 
It is basically all RNG and honestly it's pretty dogshit at the moment. 
If you want to just download and play, click moonshiners.rar. 
I will be adding a lot of features to this project such as progression based scaling and advancements, 
more cheat codes as of right now there is only one (devMode), 
and will be converting all variables to classes, 
so each item in your inventory will have modifiers associated with them.
